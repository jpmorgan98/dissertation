This chapter provides more specific background and introduction to deterministic radiation transport methods.
I discuss the state of the art in deterministic radiation transport on GPUs and the various numerical methods needed to solve the 4 independent variable particle intergro-differential equation implemented in this work.
I also summarize manuscript chapters \ref{chap:therefore_paper} and \ref{chap:smom_paper} including their contributions and relationship to my research questions from section \ref{sec:research_qustions}.

\section{S$_N$ approximation in angle}

There are two major methods of treating the double integral over all angle in Eq. \ref{eq:fullNTE}.
The method of spherical harmonics or P$_{N}$ method which takes angular moments of the transport equation then makes a closure assumption at the N\ths  order.
This work focuses on the S$_N$ or discrete ordinance approximation which turns the Eq. \ref{eq:fullNTE} into a coupled (simultaneous) set of linear partial differential equations in each angular direction using quadrature integration.
It was first formulated by Chandrasekhar to describe radiative heat transfer in stellar media \cite{chandrasekhar1960radiative}.
The S$_N$ approximation was soon applied to neutron transport by Carlson \cite{precise1971carlson}, Lee \cite{discrete1961lee}, and Lathrop \cite{discrete1966lathnrop}.
The method of discrete ordinance was also adapted to general radiative heat transfer by Fiveland \cite{three1988fiveland} and Truelove \cite{discrete1987truelove}.

At this point it becomes necessary to describe the other governing assumptions I use in this work including:
slab geometry (1D-rectilinear coordinates), isotropic scattering and sources, as well as the multi-group assumption in energy distribution.
The methods I develop in this work are not restricted by these assumptions---and future work may explore the methods described here in anisotropic distributions in angle and/or solutions on unstructured meshes---but are made here for simplicity.
In fact, I make specific decisions in this work with the underlying discretization schemes to allow for eventual extension to these regimes.

When applied to Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullNTE} the resulting initialization point is described by
\begin{multline}
    \label{sn_nte_int}
    \frac{1}{v_g} \frac{\partial \psi_{m,g}(x,t)}{\partial t} + \mu_m \frac{\partial \psi_{m,g}(x,t)}{\partial x} + \Sigma_g(x) \psi_{m,g}(x,t)  \\
     = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum\limits_{g' = 0}^G \Sigma_{s, g'\to g}(x) \sum\limits_{n=1}^N w_n \psi_{n, g'}(x,t) + Q_g(x,t) \right) \;, \\
    \qquad g=1 \ldots G \;, \qquad m=1 \ldots N \;, \qquad t > 0 \;, \qquad x \in [0,X] \;,
\end{multline}
where $\psi$ is the angular flux, $x$ and $t$ are independent continuous variables for 1D space and time respectively, $g$ is the group index, $v$ is velocity, $w$ is an angular quadrature weight, $\mu$ is the angular quadrature ordinate ($\cos(\hat{\Omega}_\theta)$), $m$ is the quadrature index, and $Q$ is the isotropic material source.
In this work I will exclusively use Gauss-Legendre quadrature, but if extended to higher dimensions other quadratures sets would be required to evaluate the double integral over both angular directions (e.g., level-symmetric). 
The initial and boundary conditions are again prescribed angular flux distributions:
\begin{equation*}
    \psi_{m,g}(x,0) = \psi_{m,0}(x), \qquad m=1 \ldots N \;,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \psi_{m,g}(0,t) = \psi_{m,L}(t), \qquad \mu_m >0 \;,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    \psi_{m,g}(X,t) = \psi_{m,R}(t), \qquad \mu_m <0 \;.
\end{equation*}
From here additional discretization can be used to turn the continuous functions of angular flux, source, material data, and differential operators into numerical approximations.

\section{Time-Space discretization schemes}

To enable this work in both space and time, discretization schemes are needed to treat the differential operators and continuous functions.
As the goal of the research is for development on heterogeneous architectures, communication to work ratio may become an issue.
Numerical algorithms that require lots of communication back and forth between the host (CPU) and device (GPU) will limit the maximum allowable performance for most GPU accelerators.
To abate this issue higher (second) order discretization schemes can be used to add to the compute work required in every iteration, thus improving the communication to work ratio.

Various classes of spatial discretizations can be used in radiation transport.
Finite difference, finite element, and finite volume methods are all often employed with the most common in radiation transport being Diamond-Differencing $\mathcal{O}(2)$.
Diamond-Difference is popular as it is the only second order space discretization that uses a single interior (cell-averaged) degree of freedom; however it only works on orthogonal grids.
%Intended future investigation of the scheme in this research are into non-uniform meshes.
To allow future work to more readily extend the algorithms described here to unstructured grids I make specific decisions about a discritization scheme---in other words, not Diamond-Differencing.
Instead I use a finite volume scheme specifically designed for use on unstructured grids called corner-balance, which was originally developed by Adams~\cite{adams_subcell_1997}.
It is a finite volume method thus it enforces conservation within subcell volumes in a spatial cell.
Simple corner balance was determined to be sufficient as it is higher $\mathcal{O}(2)$ order.
%Simple corner blance is not acrurate in the thin-limit however a slight alteration to it 
Simple corner balance is equivalent to the lumped-linear discontinuous finite element method in 1D.
This spatial discritization is similar to what has previously been implemented in both iterative algorithms explored in this work \ref{c2:precon}.

%Solving the transport equation with deterministic methods typically involves iterative schemes to converge the scattering source and transport operators (this is discussed more in section \ref{sec:intro_itterative-scheme}).
To treat the continuous operators in time, implicit time marching schemes are often used to time step as they have desirable stability properties.
Specifically, implicit (backward) Euler $\mathcal{O}(1)$ or Crank--Nicolson $\mathcal{O}(2)$ \cite{nicolson_phd, Crank_Nicolson_1947} are the most often employed.
%These schemes are advantageous as they often act like a wrapper around a steady state deterministic transport solver with few changes needed to implement.
While Crank-Nicolson is second order accurate it is not robust and can produce negative solutions and spurious osculations.
Time dependent version of the multiple balance approach was derived by Variansyah, Larsen, and Martin~\cite{variansyah_robust_2021, ilham_phd} to be a robust, higher (second) order time discretization scheme.
The multiple-balance balance methods was originally developed as a space discretization scheme.

The full space-time-energy-angle discritization scheme is derived in chapter \ref{chap:therefore_paper} and is explicitly shown in Equations \eqref{eq:scatter_mg} and \eqref{eq:fullOCI_mg}.

\section{Iterative Methods}

The linear system of equations formed by the space-energy-time-angle discritization scheme described in the previous sections can be posed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:introaxb}
    \bm{A}x=b \; ,
\end{equation}
where $x$ is generically a dependent quantity of interest and specifically in this work: angular flux ($\psi$). 
This linear system of equations may be solved directly (e.g., LU decomposition with pivoting) or iteratively (e.g., Jacobi or Gauss--Seidel iterations).
The dimensions of these problems is \emph{huge} and \emph{sparse}, going by the number of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item angles in quadrature: \num{10}--\num{100};
    \item energy groups: \num{1}--\num{100};
    \item sub-cell discretizations: 4; and
    \item spatial cells: which can be hundreds upto millions for 1D problems.
\end{itemize}
This is the impact of the \emph{curse of dimensionality} and is only further compounded when moving to higher spatial dimensions. 
Direct simulations are often prohibitively memory and computationally expensive.
Most often these systems are solved with some kind of iterative scheme.

To solve the discritization system iteratively, a fixed point (or Richardson) scheme is often used.
They are broad class of iterative methods where \emph{old} information (from the immediately previous iteration) is used to forum a new right hand side, which in turn is re-solved for a new estimation of the quantity of interest.
Thus the direct formulation in Eq. \eqref{eq:introaxb} becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:introopsplit}
    \bm{A}x^{(l+1)} = b x^{(l)}
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the iteration index.
At the first iterate the dependent variable is either guessed, estimated, or if running time dependent problem, the converged solution from the previous time step.
The iteration will continue until the quantity of interest stops changing between iterations: when the scheme has \emph{converged}.

There are other classes of iteration schemes. 
The most common is GMRES (\textbf{G}eneralized \textbf{M}inimal \textbf{RES}idual method) which is a more clever way of determining an \emph{optimal} guesses at the beginning of each iteration.
GMRES keeps solutions of the dependent variable at multiple iterations and finds a guess that is orthogonal to previous guesses \cite{kylov2004warsa, subspace2004warsa, gmres1996kelley, patton_gmres_2002}.
In effect it is a way of analyzing how the solution is chaining iteration-to-iteration then picking a new starting point at a location that is interpolated to be the closest to a \emph{converged} solution.
Newton iterations are another solver technique which uses information about the derivatives of the systems with respect to their independent variables to solve for a new guess \cite{ctkelle_newton}.
This work focuses on fixed point iterations but other iteration schemes could be explored for future work.

The process of separating components of the dependent variable to either side of an equation, letting one lag, and solving for an update is called \emph{operator splitting}.
The specifics of a given operator splitting will determine the organization of the linear systems in $\bm{A}$ and $b$, which in turn will determine how they can be efficiently solved within each iteration (to get $x^{(l+1)}$) and what tools can be used to implement those solvers (more on this in sections \ref{c2:source_iterations} and \ref{c2:oci}).
The operator splitting will also impact how many iterations it will take to reach convergence (more on this in sections \ref{c2:precon} and \ref{c2:specrad}).
For high fidelity problems these systems are still massive, and require their solution to be computed in parallel on modern high performance computers (more on this in section \ref{c2:hpc}).


\subsection{Eigenvalues and the Spectral Radius}
\label{c2:specrad}

Eigenvalues are useful to measure many parameters in numerical and physical analysis \cite{maggie_phd}.
In it's most pure forum an eigen-system (with eigenvalues and vectors) describes how a repeated process impacts the elements of a system and takes the forum
\begin{equation}
    \bm{T}v = \lambda v \;,
\end{equation}
where $v$ are the eigenvector and $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue.
For dynamical systems they can be used classify the regions of stability (e.g., in control theory).
For oscillatory systems they define regions where independent variable align to result in a maximum or minimum value we call a \emph{harmonic} (e.g., a fundamental frequency is repeated over and over again at even intervals of frequency).

In this work I exclusively use eigenvalues to describe how error of our dependent quantity of interest is propagated through either time stepping or through iterating.
For the former we use it to define stability, and prove that our space-time discritization scheme is \emph{unconditionally stable}.
We can do this because if the all eigenvalues are below a certain threshold the compounding effect of error incurred at every single time step will remain bounded.
For the latter we use the eigen spectrum of the iteration system formed by operator splitting and preconditioners to evaluate convergence rates.
For example we can describe \eqref{eq:introopsplit} as
\begin{equation}
    x^{(l+1)} = \bm{T}x^{(l)} \; ,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    \bm{T} = \bm{A}^{-1}b \; .
\end{equation}
$\bm{T}$ is applied to the quantity of interest over and over and over again as we iterate.
So if we wanted to we could reform our iteration as
\begin{equation}
    x^{(l)} = \bm{T}^{l}x^{(0)} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $x^{(0)}$ is the initial guess and $\bm{T}^{l}$ is raising $\bm{T}$ to the $l$\ths power.
In this forum we can see that our iteration is doing the same thing to a square matrix over and over again.
The concept is the same for time stepping as each time step is the reapplication of the same square time-stepping matrix.
To solve practical problems we never do that as usually $\bm{A}$ is to big to analytically invert and we don't know the structure of $T$ as it requires a priori information about the solution which we only have for problems known anaclitic solutions.
So we limit our analysis to model problems, often for radiation transport the infinite homogeneous pure absorber.

Deriving $T$ can be done with Von Neumann stability analysis also known as Fourier stability analysis.
The error on our discretization stencil is expanded in a series of temporal or spatial Fourier modes, where each mode has a coefficient, an amplitude ($\lambda$), and a shape function (commonly $e^{i\omega x}=\cos{\omega x} + i\sin{\omega x}$).
The amplitude is the eigenvalue at a given frequency $\omega$.
As this is a sinusoidal system we can evaluate all the eigenvalues by looking at a bounded $\omega \in [0, 2\pi]$
Once we construct $T$ we use a solver from a linear algebra library to compute it's eigenvalues ($\lambda_T$)\footnote{e.g., $\lambda_T =$ \texttt{numpy.linalg.eig(T)} \cite{van_der_walt_numpy_2011}}.

To ensure a time stepping scheme is unconditionally stable we have to ensure
\begin{equation}
    \sup_{\omega\in[0,2\pi]}|\lambda_T| \leq 1.0 \; ,
\end{equation}
which is the \emph{von Neumann stability criterion}.
This equation is for the maximum of the absolute values (eigenvalues can be complex and/or negative) of the eigenvalues to be less then or equal to one.
As the eigenvalues measure how much error is increasing through time we can say that if it's less then one it is bounded.
If it is greater then one then the error will grow exponentially time step to time step.
Notably $\bm{T}$ will have the time step size contained within it so this analysis can be repeated at various time steps.

For convergence rate we define
\begin{equation}
    \rho \equiv \sup_{\omega\in[0,2\pi]}|\lambda_T| < 1.0 \; ,
\end{equation}
and is the \emph{spectral radius} ($\rho$) of an iterative method.
The spectral radius is again a measure of error chaining through a repeated process, only here it's iteration to iteration.
In this case $T$ will have information about scattering, total absorption, and spatial discritization so we can evaluate the spectral radius over a parameter space.
For an iterative scheme to be convergent it must be wholly less then unity.
Furthermore as $\rho$ gets smaller between $[0,1)$, the iteration converges faster.
Effectively $\rho$ is the slope on a log-log plot of the residual which is computed to test convergence.
The spectral radius can be empirically measured by any transport solver by computing,
\begin{equation}
    \rho_e = \frac{||x^{l+1 } - x^{l}||_{2}}{||x^{l} - x^{l-1}||_{2}} = \frac{error^{l+1}}{error^{l}}
\end{equation}
This could be done for a number of reasons like to control of false convergence, trigger in-situ algorithm adaptions, or verify the implementation of a transport solver against anaclitic Fourier analysis as they should match when running the same problem.

One thing to note is that the spectral radius is defined as the absolute value.
However, the eigenvalues which actually govern convergence behavior may be complex.
In this complex eigen values arise in this work from both choices of time stepping scheme \cite{ilham_phd, ilham} and as a consequence of an iterative method used in this work.
This impacts convergence rate leading to oscillations in the residual and empirical measurements of spectral radius (see section \ref{sec:results-faoci} for more).
This was very surprising and took a while to sus out as I thought I was just wrong.

While not a novel discovery this is one of the most interesting findings of this work from my own perspective.
This bucked my understanding of something I learned from numerical methods classes and written in textbooks.
That spectral radius \emph{governed} convergence and it is always real.
At this depth of work we cannot always treat the sources of old as gospel truth.
Appendix \ref{chap:spec_rads} shows plots of the entire eigen function of the two iteration schemes explored in this dissertation at various points in phase space.

John Crank and Phyllis Nicolson briefly described this method of analysis in 1947 while investigating the stability of numerical methods for use in solving the heat equation \cite{nicolson_phd}.
Their work would later become the Crank--Nicolson method \cite{Crank_Nicolson_1947}
Charney, FjÖrtof, and von Neumann later described the method in greater detail while studying vorticity in the Earths atmosphere in 1950 \cite{charney_1950_stabilityAnylisys}.


\subsection{Source-iteration}
\label{c2:source_iterations}

The source iteration (SI) method is common operator splitting for the radiation transport equation.
The contribution to the solution from the scattering source (summation in the RHS of Eq.~\eqref{sn_nte_int}) is allowed to lag, while the angular flux is solved in every ordinate via transport ``sweeps" through the spatial domain \cite{lewis_computational_1984}.
It is often accompanied by preconditioners or synthetic accelerators (more on this in section \ref{c2:precon}) and GMRES.
SI sweeps in Cartesian geometries are readily parallelized over the number of angles, as the source term is known from the previous iteration, allowing the angular flux in each ordinate to be computed independently.
While any parallelization is a benifit to performance, a scheme that is embarrassingly parallel over the dimension with the greatest number of degrees of freedom---space---may be advantageous.
In a single spatial dimension SI is \textit{annoying serial} in space and cannot be parallelized.
In curvilinear geometries (e.g. spherical or cylindrical) other parallelism schemes may exist \cite{palmer_phd}.

In higher spatial dimensions, many S$_N$ production codes that implement SI use some kind of wavefront marching parallel algorithm also known as a Kockh-Baker-Alcouff scheme \cite{baker_kba_2017, colomer_parallel_2013} also called "full parallel sweeps" in literature.
In this scheme a sweep begins in a spatial location where all cell dependencies are known from boundary information (e.g., a corner).
From there on a hypothetical 2D grid, the two nearest neighbor cells are computed independently, potentially in parallel; the next step would be 4 cells.
This diagonally expanding wavefront continues to march and is able to better parallelize as many cells spatially as possible eventually saturating the number of work threads if the problem is large enough.
%On CPUs this has been shown to be performant but this changing amount of work is not optimal on GPUs where.
%Performance evaluations of production codes that implement KBA on GPUs is sparse in literature and when avaliable is from proxy-apps.
%Ardra has such a proxy app 
%KBA algorithms are also tricky to efficiently implement in domain decomposed where wave front propagation between boundaries can be tricky.
%While this work is concerned with 1 spatial dimension when analyzing the state of the art it is important to consider that this is done.

%This has proven successful in modern transport applications on CPUs 
%(e.g., PARTISN, which implements the Koch--Baker--Alcouffe or KBA algorithm). 
%The state of the art in deterministic S$_N$ radiation transport is multi-group in energy distribution, diamond differencing first order space discretizations or other FEM FVM schemes on unstructured meshes, backward euler time stepping, domain decomposition via parallel block Jacobi, wave front marching schemes like KBA in higher spatial dimensions within a subdomain, and source iterations with diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) and potentially accompanied by GMRES solvers. Some examples of production codes that implement this are Partisn, Ardra, Minerate, Capsaicin, Denovo, Silver Fir, etc.
%Here again this is included as a
%Each one of these points becomes more difficult to implement due to angle-parallel SI with KBA, for example domain decomposition 

%Published literature on what schemes are implemented, how and their performance on GPU accelerators is sparse.
%Most of my understanding of what is currently used comes from conversations held at conferences with the developers of the codes themselves.
%One place I was able to find performance data on is a mini-app called Kripky \cite{kunen_kripke_2015}.
%Kripke is the publicly distributed version of Ardra that has performance data available.
%Roofline anylisys of Kripke has been published for performance on an AMD MI200 GPUs \cite{wolfe2022roofline}. 
%Specific k
%We conject that this is due to the nonlinear work load a wavefront marching schemes incurred. 


\subsection{One-cell inversion-iteration}
\label{c2:oci}
% Intro to OCI and previous work including warsaw 

One-cell inversion (OCI) are a class of operator splittings where all angular fluxes in all ordinates and groups within a cell are computed in a single linear algebra solve, assuming that the angular fluxes incident on the surfaces of the cell are known from a previous iteration \cite{kang2000oci}.
OCI methods allow parallelizing over the number of cells, as each cell is solved independently in parallel.
OCI iterations can take the form of a cell-wise block-Jacobi, cell-wise block-Gauss--Seidel, or cell-wise red-black iteration depending on the order in which cells are inverted \cite{man1994parallel}.
Like SI, OCI iterations can be fixed-point (Richardson) or non-stationary schemes like GMRES \cite{kylov2004warsa}, with or without preconditioners (including diffusion synthetic acceleration \cite{kang2000oci}) (more on this in section \ref{c2:precon}) on structured and unstructured meshes.
Parallel block Jacobi and parallel block Gauss--Seidel iterations may also be used for domain decomposition with transport sweeps within subdomains \cite{qiao_improved_2021}.
In fact, OCI methods can be thought of as a cellular decomposed version of these schemes.

\cite{rosa_cellwise_2013} previously studied cell-wise block Jacobi and cell-wise block Gauss--Seidel as a potentially superior iterative scheme over SI preconditioned with diffusion synthetic acceleration on vectorized architectures.
They hypothesized that OCI schemes might outperform an SI preconditioned with diffusion synthetic acceleration and using full-parallel sweeps in terms of wall-clock runtime, because of OCI's parallelism over the dominant domain (space), the ability to take advantage of vendor-supplied LAPACK type libraries, high arithmetic-intensity operations present in an OCI algorithm, and superior spectral properties in the thick limit.
Rosa et al.\ conducted Fourier analysis for and implemented OCI in a 2D, multi-group, steady-state code using bilinear discontinuous finite elements to discretize space.
They paired this with either a cell-wise block Jacobi and cell-wise block Gauss--Seidel iteration algorithm.
The study was conducted on the (then) state-of-the-art RoadRunner supercomputer and took advantage of its 64-bit PowerXCell vectorized accelerator.
However, the acceleration per iteration in the block Gauss--Seidel OCI implementation did not make up for the degradation of convergence that OCI methods incur in the thin limit.
%They concluded by suggesting that future developments in GPU accelerators might overcome this hurtle.

OCI can require more iterations to converge to a solution for some problems, since no information exchanges between cells within an iteration.
Specifically, as cellular optical thickness decreases, OCI's relative performance degrades. %(weather, block Jacobi or block Gauss-Seidel).
Spectral radius ($\rho$) of OCI tends to unity in the thin cell limit---regardless of the scattering ratio---due to the algorithm decoupling cells from one another (i.e., asynchronicity) \cite{rosa_cellwise_2013, hoagland_hybrid_2021, man1994parallel}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:c2_ss-sepcrad} illustrates this behavior, showing the spectral radii of the two iteration schemes as a function of cellular optical thickness, $\delta$ (in mean free paths), and the scattering ratio, $c$.
We compute these values using Fourier analysis of an infinite medium slab problem using S$_{8}$ angular quadrature for block Jacobi OCI and unpreconditioned SI iterative schemes.
The spectral radius of SI depends strongly on the scattering ratio but is independent of $\delta$ for the homogeneous infinite-medium problem. 
Compared to SI, OCI rapidly converges in thicker cells, even in highly scattering problems except for scattering ratios closest to one.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/therefore_figs/ss_specrads.pdf}
    \caption{Spectral radii (${\rho}$) of steady-state OCI (left) and SI (right), where $c$ is the scattering ratio and ${\delta}$ is the cellular optical thickness in mean free paths from Fourier analysis in S$_8$.}
    \label{fig:c2_ss-sepcrad}
\end{figure}

Others have explored OCI as an acceleration scheme for SI \cite{hoagland_hybrid_2021}, a component of a multi-grid solver \cite{man1995multigrid1, man1996multigrid2}, and a solution to the integral transport matrix method \cite{raffi2108pidotscom}.
However, previous investigations of OCI are limited to steady-state computations.

When employing implicit time-differencing schemes (e.g., Crank--Nicholson, backward Euler), each time step involves the solution of a steady-state transport problem with an effective total cross section that includes a time absorption term, proportional to $1/(v \Delta t)$, where $\Delta t$ is time step size and $v$ is radiation speed.
Returning to Fig.~\ref{fig:ss-sepcrad}, the macroscopic total cross section ($\Sigma$) influences both the optical thickness of the cell ($\delta$) and the scattering ratio ($c$), so increasing or decreasing $\Sigma$ will impact convergence behavior.
Spectral radius for both iterative methods decreases as the scattering ratio decreases, but \textit{the spectral radius of OCI also decreases with increasing optical thickness}, which in turn depends on $\Sigma$.
When solving optically thin and highly scattering problems, small increases to $\Sigma$ (and for time-dependent problems, decreases in $\Delta t$ or $v$) may drastically improve the relative performance of OCI compared to SI.
This hypothesis motivates our work, along with evaluating cell-wise algorithms on modern GPU accelerators and exploring higher-order space-time discretization schemes.

\subsection{Preconditioners and Synthetic acceleration}
\label{c2:precon}
Preconditioners can be used to aid convergence of iterative schemes for the neutron transport equation \cite{adams_fast_2002}.
Often physics informed preconditioners for transport iterations may be thought of as high-order method solving the full discretized transport equation and a low-order method informing intra-iteration updates to then be used in the next iteration of the high-order problem.
The low-order method is usually some physics-informed problem that is computationally cheaper to solve then the transport problem and models physical behavior that is difficult for a given operator splitting to converge (e.g., the diffusive limit, $c\rightarrow1$).

Synthetic acceleration schemes are a common subset of preconditioners for the source iteration operator splitting.
A synthetic acceleration method only \textit{accelerates} convergence to the same solution as transport and is fully consistent with the high-order transport method.
Generally for synthetic acceleration methods the low-order simulation is \textit{driven} by the error between iterates of a transport solve.
Synthetic acceleration techniques for source iterations include:
boundary projection acceleration \cite{adams_boundary_1988}, 
transport synthetic acceleration \cite{ramone_1997_tsa},
multi-grid methods \cite{man1994parallel},
and the venerable diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) \cite{larsen_1983_dsaforsn} among others.

Diffusion synthetic acceleration is a common preconditioner for the source iteration operator splitting \cite{adams_fast_2002, alcouffe_1977_dd, coale_2025_dsa}.
It implements a low-order diffusion solve driven by the error between subsequent transport iterations to inform a correction term for the scalar flux, which can in turn be used as the source in a subsequent high-order source iteration.
To make DSA consistent the specific structures of the low-order diffusion solve is governed by the spatial discretization scheme used in the high-order transport simulation.
Larsen's 4-step method can be used to yield a DSA scheme that is consistent with spatial discritization, however, the system of equations produced from a Larsen 4-step process can be difficult to solve, or forum inconsistent schemes for finite elements in higher dimensions \cite{larsen_1982_unconDSA, larsen_1982_unconDSAte, haut_2020_dsa}. 
The Adams-Martin modified 4-step process produces consistent schemes with finite element discritization methods \cite{adams_1992_dsadfe}.
Consistent DSA-SI schemes produce rapidly convergent iteration methods where $\rho<c/3$ in homogeneous regions.

Another class of physics informed preconditioners for the radiation transport equation that do not fall into the sub-category of synthetic acceleration are the moment expatiation methods including: second moment (also called Lewis \& Miller methods) \cite{olivier_2024_smoms, lewis_computational_1984, oliver_2025_secondmoment}, quasi-diffusion \cite{ani_1986_quasidiffusion, goldin_1964_quasidissuion}, and variable Eddington factor \cite{lou_2021_vef, coale_2024_rmomvef} methods.
All of these preconditioners are themselves a set of High-Low (HOLO) methods \cite{chacon_2017_holosurvey}.
They still use the same general algorithm as synthetic acceleration where information from the high-order transport solve somehow drives the low-order problem, often with additional physical characteristics (e.g., volumetric material source).
Then the low-order solution some how updates information going into the high-order system.
These methods are often inconsistent with the transport equation thus potentially solving a different physical interpretation of the problem physics, but they can be very rapidly convergent.

There is less research on preconditioners for OCI when used alone as the primary space-parallel iterative scheme.
OCI itself has previously been used as an acceleration method for source iterations in the forum of either a multi-grid in space solver \cite{kang2000oci, man1994parallel} or a true hybrid scheme (using the same transport mesh) with SI \cite{hoagland_hybrid_2021}.
Rosa and Warsa showed that transport synthetic acceleration (TSA) can resynchronize cells but TSA still requires a potentially expensive sweep operation \cite{tsa2009rosa}.
Figure \ref{fig:ss_spec_rads} at right shows the spectral radius of TSA-OCI (using no scattering information ($\beta=1$, e.g., a transport sweep between OCI solves).
Notably for OCI-TSA with $\beta=1$ the method is still potentially unconvergent in the diffusive limit.
However as $\beta\rightarrow0$ and more scattering physics is included in the low order simulation convergence in the diffusive limit will also be supported.
The search for non-sweeping---ideally space-parallel or otherwise computationally cheap---preconditioner for OCI to more rapidly converge in the diffusive and thin limits motivates this work.

Yavuz and Larsen described a second moment method they used to accelerate domain decomposed SI sweeps \cite{yavuz_spatial_1989}.
They use source iterations within a subdomain and Jacobi iterations to converge incident angular flux between subdomains.
Their method uses a low-order second moment system of equations to inform updates of incident angular flux on the boundaries of each subdomain.
Thus the high-order solver is \textit{not} the SI transport solve but instead the Jacobi iteration.
With their method Yavuz and Larsen showed decreased Jacobi iteration counts for 1D and 2D problems on rectilinear grids \cite{yavuz_spatial_1989, yavuz_1992_2ddd}.
This scheme may aid the convergence of OCI.

\section{Summary of Part and Relation to Research Questions}

Chapter \ref{chap:therefore_paper} analyzes how the convergence rate of an OCI scheme behaves when used for time-dependent neutron transport computations.
I derive a second-order space-time discretization method from the simple corner balance and multiple balance time discretization schemes and show via Fourier analysis that it is unconditionally stable through time.
Then, I derive and numerically solve the Fourier systems for both OCI and SI splittings of the discretization, showing that small mean-free times improve the spectral radius of OCI more than SI, and that the spectral radius for OCI tends to zero as mean free time gets smaller.
I extend both solvers to be energy dependent (using the multi-group assumption) and implement them on an AMD MI250X using vendor-supplied batched LAPACK solvers.
I show that smaller time steps improve the relative performance of OCI over SI, and, even when OCI requires more iterations to converge a problem, those iterations can be done much faster on a GPU.
This leads to OCI performing better overall than SI on GPUs.
This chapter answers research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{RQ1}: How to use software engineering libraries to implement work more efficiently;
    \item \emph{RQ2}: A space-parallel iterative scheme on modern HPC GPUs; and
    \item \emph{RQ3}: How transient behavior impacts convergence of a space-parallel iterative scheme.
\end{itemize}
This work is novel as it is the first time OCI has been implemented on modern GPUs, the firs time OCI has been used to solve transient systems, the first time the time dependent multiple balance approach has been used in conjunction with OCI or the simple corner balance spital discritization scheme, and the first published use of strided batched solvers for OCI on the GPU allowing the use of vendor supplied libraries instead of manually scripted GPU kernels.

Chapter \ref{chap:smom_paper} derives a preconditioner to converge OCI faster in the diffusive limit.
I derive a second moment cellular decomposition method in conjunction with a one-cell inversion iteration in an effort to produce a fully space parallel, rapidly convergent, transport iteration.
THe method we use is based on a preconditioner derived for domain decomposed problems.
The second moment preconditioner derived in this work does not converge to the same solution as unpreconditioned transport solutions suggesting inconsistencies between the high and low order equations.
Numerical experiments show the second moment preconditioner is rapidly convergent in the diffusive limit but dose not aid convergence in the optically thin limit.
This chapter answers research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{RQ1}: How to use software engineering libraries to implement work more efficiently on modern computing architectures; and
    \item \emph{RQ4}: How to accelerate the space-parallel iterative scheme to converge faster.
\end{itemize}
