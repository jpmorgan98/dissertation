It produces machine code that runs outside of the single-threaded Python interpreter, and that fully utilizes the resources of modern CPUs. This means support for parallel multithreading and auto-vectorization if available, as with compiled languages such as C++ or Fortran. In this article, we document our experience developing PyExaFMM, a multithreaded Numba implementation of the fast multipole method, an algorithm with a nonlinear data structure and a large amount of data organization. We find that designing performant Numba code for complex algorithms can be as challenging as writing in a compiled language.},
