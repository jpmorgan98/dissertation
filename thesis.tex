\chapter*{Unconventional Acknowledgment}
I am a rather unconventional person and as such I make an unconventional acknowledgment.
I wasn't really sure if I was going to put this in here but it feels important.
This might be the only work of mine that ever is kept and as such, as this is the one thing that will be marked with my name till the end of archival systems it was important for me to put this on the record.

To the bureaucrats who cried crocodile tears when I requested basic human dignity.\\
To those who made a wounded and lonely child feel more isolated and confused.\\
To those who said, ``I can't tell my daughters that this is something that is ok".\\
To those who have accosted me on the street with slurs and epithets.\\
To those with political power who seek to exterminate me and my people\\
To those who have assaulted, trafficked, beat, and raped me.

I could've never known my own strength without your cruelty.
In a way, you have given me knowledge of my power which many go their who lives without knowing.
That I can scratch out a life, protect those I love, and survive.

I wish you no ill will.
As much as I can---I forgive you.
I pray that our ever-loving lord shows you mercy and that you find peace before your time on this Earth is over.
I trust that in His good time and grace---we will all heal.
